Under Water Effect 1.0

========================

This system brings various visual effects that make a similar effect to images underwater.

To use this system, simply associate the code 'UnderWaterEffect' with your player's camera 
and associate the corresponding items with each variable of the same.

Each variable has a description of its use, just rest the mouse on it.

The area in which the submersion effect should occur must have a collider with the 'isTrigger'
option checked. This collider must also have a specific tag in order to distinguish these 
areas from the others in the scene. The tag for this collider must be associated with the 
script in the 'WaterTag' variable, in order for the script to recognize the collider.

The system has several effects, such as:

- Distortion of the image
- Image coloring under water
- Droplet effects on the screen
- Image haze under water
- Limitation of vision under water

The system has some variables, allowing to regulate how perceptible these effects will be.

The example scene has three cameras, with different settings, with the intention of 
demonstrating how the effect adapts to different waters.

To test the scene, simply start it and follow the button commands, 'next' to move to the next
camera, 'Up' and 'Down' to move up and down with the camera, to see how the submersion effect works .
